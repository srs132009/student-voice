    <h1>Merit. Memory. Resistance.</h1>
    <p>A teenager’s voice on education, politics, and broken promises</p>
  </header>

  <div class="container">
    <div class="essay">
      <p>I used to think loyalty was simple. Pick a side, defend it everywhere, especially at family dinners where logic goes to die and WhatsApp forwards get PhDs. I did that. Loud. Relentless. BJP was my side. Right wing. Nation first. Discipline. Outcomes.</p>

      <p>Then the UGC rule landed. No drumroll. Just impact.</p>

      <p>Overnight, the scoreboard was quietly edited. The same system that sold us the dream of “work hard, merit wins” slipped in fine print. Merit, but adjustable. Equality, but curated. Reverse discrimination rebranded as progress.</p>

      <div class="highlight">
        The sawarn student was expected to clap politely while the finish line moved.
      </div>

      <p>I didn’t feel angry. Worse. I felt used. The kind of betrayal that hits at 2 a.m. during mock tests, when the system demands excellence from you and excuses for everyone else, then lectures you about fairness.</p>

      <p>The obvious response was rage. No votes. Walk away. Let loyalty expire. But then comes the pause. Congress. Worse policies, louder confusion, and identity politics on steroids.</p>

      <p>So here we stand. Teenagers with coaching bags heavier than our trust in institutions. Preparing for exams that decide our future while policies are written by people who cleared theirs decades ago.</p>

      <p>This story doesn’t end with a hero. It ends with a generation that refuses to forget. We don’t want favors. We want a level field.</p>

      <div class="highlight">
        Until then, we study. Because marks remember. And students do too.
      </div>
          <section class="library">
        <h2>Student Library</h2>
        <p>A space for stories, poems, essays, and reading material written by students. Voices that don’t fit into policy PDFs.</p>
